## [1.0.0] â€“ 2025-05-11

### Added
- Initial release of the **Ross AGI Score (RAS)** framework (v1.0).
- Defined 15 AGI Capability Levels (ACLs) with behavioral descriptors from narrow AI to strong superintelligence.
- Introduced the RAS scorecard structure for multidimensional evaluation.
- Specified AGI stage classification (Narrow AI, Emergent AGI, Full AGI, Super-AGI) with minimum profile requirements.
- Published stable version archive: `/archive/ras_v1.0_stable_may2025.md`.
- Added supporting files:
  - `ross_agi_score.md`
  - `scorecard_template.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `LICENSE.md`

## Planned

- **Scoring Methodology Manual**: Add a detailed instruction guide for how to evaluate and assign scores for each RAS dimension, including test types, human calibration baselines, and example scoring rubrics.
- **Reference Expansion**: Integrate formal academic references (journal articles, position papers, benchmark studies) to support the historical context and claims made throughout the framework.
- **Public Feedback Integration**: Open a GitHub discussion and feedback form to gather community input on RAS dimension definitions, level boundaries, and stage classification.
- **arXiv Submission Preparation**: Finalize version 1.1 draft with citation formatting, author metadata, and abstract to prepare for preprint submission to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org).
- **Evaluation Toolkit (Phase 1)**: Begin structuring a minimal task suite (RAS-Eval v0.1) aligned to the 15 ACL levels with instructions for reproducible scoring across systems.
