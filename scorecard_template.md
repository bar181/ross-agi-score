## ðŸ§© AGI Stage Classification (Tick one)

- [ ] Stage I: Narrow AI (ACL 1â€“6, insufficient generality)
- [ ] Stage II: Emergent AGI (ACL 7â€“9, generalization with some gaps)
- [ ] Stage III: Full AGI (ACL 10, human-level across all dimensions)
- [ ] Stage IV: Super-AGI (ACL 11â€“15+, superhuman in â‰¥1 dimension)

**Justification:**  
> _Summarize rationale for AGI stage assignment. Reference dimension scores and profile coverage._
